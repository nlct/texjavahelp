Help library for Java GUI applications with LaTeX source

**Work in progress.**

The aim is to produce an alternative to JavaHelp for my Java GUI applications.
The documentation source will be in LaTeX, but it needs to be simple enough for
the [TeX Parser Library](https://github.com/nlct/texparser) to parse.
This means that the same source can be used to create both the PDF documentation
and the in-application help.
